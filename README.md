# 🧠 African Languages for Emotion Analysis
**Enhancing Emotion Classification through Data Augmentation Strategies for Low-Resource African Languages**

This repository contains the code, models, and data processing workflows for our research on applying **data augmentation** techniques to improve **multi-label emotion classification** in **low-resource African languages** — specifically Swahili, Hausa, and Afrikaans — using the **BRIGHTER dataset** and the `Davlan/afro-xlmr-small` model.

## 📘 Project Overview

Despite rapid progress in NLP, **low-resource African languages** remain severely underrepresented in emotion classification research. This project evaluates the effectiveness of **three data augmentation techniques**:
- **Random Insertion using fastText**
- **Masked Token Prediction (MLM)**
- **Round-Trip Back Translation (Helsinki-NLP & NLLB)**

All experiments are conducted using the **Davlan/afro-xlmr-small** transformer model, trained on a subset of the **BRIGHTER dataset** for Swahili, Hausa, and Afrikaans.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To set up the environment, ensure you have Python 3.8–3.10 installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In addition, your system must support the following CLI tools for downloading and extracting fastText vectors:

- `wget`
- `unzip`

These can be installed via your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `brew`, or `choco` depending on OS).

> 💡 Pre-trained word vectors for Swahili, Hausa, and Afrikaans are downloaded directly from [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html).

## 🚀 How to Run

You can execute each experiment by opening the corresponding notebook under `/notebooks`:

| Task                              | Notebook Name                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Baseline training                | `1_basemodel.ipynb`           |
| Random Insertion Augmentation    | `2_random_insertion.ipynb`    |
| Masked Language Model Augmentation | `3_masking.ipynb`            |
| Back Translation Augmentation    | `4_back_translation.ipynb`    |
